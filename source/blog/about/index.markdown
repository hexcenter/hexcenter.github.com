I’m a Software Engineering student and I’m currently studying at “EPITECH - The European Institute of Technology” where I learn every day about Programing language, Mathematics, Computer Science, ..

Aside from the university program, I like work and practice on Algorithms and Mathematics contest with Topcoder, Google Jam or USACO because I truly think that there are more advantages to learn in practice rather than from books, that also is why I take lot of in my own time, contribute with the Open source communauty via mailing list or IRC.

Futhermore I also am really interesting about Electronics, even though there are not lot of courses about the subject in my University. I take time to learn it myself. Using tools like Arduino - the open source microcontroler - I try to make some king of hack projects done inspire by website like Hack a Day, Adafruit, Insctructable..

## Pierre Ecormier

So I'm Pierre, born in Reunion Island and now studying in Lille, at Epitech. This is where I learn mostly programming, with a little bit of mathematics.

I really like coding graphical projects, like video games or purely graphical experimentations. Probably because I find it so much more rewarding to have something displayed correctly when you succeed.

I'm also a bit into hacking... I started learning it recently, and now I try to improve my knowledge by doing contests (Steria, Nuit du hack & Hack in Paris, RSSIL) and online challenges (mostly on [root-me.org](http://root-me.org)).
